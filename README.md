Speed Reader is a simple web application designed to help you read and learn faster by training focus, perception, and inner silence.

The app lets users upload a PDF and scan text at higher words per minute through intentional states of awareness. The goal is to quiet the inner narrative so information can be absorbed more directly, with less mental friction.

HOW IT WORKS:

Upload a PDF and extract readable text.

Present words in a controlled, high speed flow.

Use a colored anchor letter within each word to lock your focus.

Let your brain handle pattern recognition and context naturally.

Train yourself to read faster, learn faster, and process information more efficiently.

WHY IT WORKS:

Based on early user feedback that was rapidly implemented, the anchor letter feature helps stabilize attention. By focusing on a single visual point, your mind can relax its internal narration and shift into faster, more intuitive comprehension.

Over time, this trains:

-Faster reading speed
-Improved focus
-Reduced subvocalization
-Better information retention

This tool is about training awareness, not forcing speed. With practice, you can move from traditional reading into a more fluid, silent, and efficient way of learning.

Built for experimentation, learning, and pushing the limits of how the mind processes written information.
